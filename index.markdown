## Welcome!

Weâ€™re a group of casual players of different types of mahjong.  Currently we play Wright Patterson and riichi, and we'll likely start playing American soon as well.

A regular meeting time is currently up in the air as we establish the club, but will likely be

**Saturdays at 7:30 PM**

at **Hooked**

3142 E Michigan Ave,
<br>Lansing, MI
<br>48912

The meeting for this week (the week of October 26) is at that time and place.

Anyone is welcome to join or sit in, no experience is necessary (we will teach you, or you can watch until you feel comfortable playing)!  There is no membership fee and you do not need to bring anything.

You might also be interested in the [Southeast Michigan Riichi group](https://semiriichi.github.io/).  They are larger than us and meet more often.  You should also probably check out their website regardless, they have good mahjong info and resources.
